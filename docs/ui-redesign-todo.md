# UI Redesign Backlog

Tracking list for the Kimi Store UI overhaul. Storefront tasks are prioritized; admin dashboard follow afterwards.

## Storefront (Now)

- [x] Audit current storefront IA, shared copy data, and design tokens.
- [x] Redefine the design language (updated tokens, typography scale, glass gradients, elevated cards, motion).
- [x] Rebuild global layout (header, footer, responsive nav, locale/auth controls).
- [x] Refresh landing hero + promotional rail with higher-impact storytelling.
- [x] Unify product card treatments (hover states, badges, price emphasis).
- [x] Restructure featured collections section with scrollable chips & quick filters.
- [x] Add editorial lookbook / lifestyle strip tying into About page storytelling.
- [x] Modernize blog highlights (paired cards, meta, action).
- [x] Update Men/Women/New Arrivals/Sale index templates with consistent grid + filter bars.
- [x] Redesign product detail (media sequence, sticky CTAs, spec blocks, trust signals).
- [ ] Polish transactional flows (cart, checkout, wishlist, contact, account overview).
- [ ] Ensure `translateCopy` is applied across storefront views for locale accuracy.
- [ ] Accessibility + responsive QA (focus rings, contrast, mobile nav behavior).

## Admin (Next)

- [ ] Evaluate admin shell and sidebar IA once storefront work stabilizes.
- [ ] Port new tokens and typography scale to dashboard primitives.
- [ ] Redesign dashboards (overview widgets, tables, timelines) with updated data viz styling.
- [ ] Align CRUD module templates (products, orders, CMS, etc.) with refreshed form patterns.

## Delivery Notes

- Capture decisions and component usage guidance inside `/docs` as features land.
- Keep screenshots / recordings for handoff once both surfaces are refreshed.
